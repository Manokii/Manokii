### Greetings my awesome friends in the internet~!

I am [Jasper Concepcion](https://manok.dev), I write instructions to a rock that is tricked into thinking (better known as a computer). I am currently a senior software engineer at [AcadArena](https://acadarena.com). I have been coding for more than 5 years now!

I play video games, watch anime, and code a lot even in my free time, i just enjoy it. 

My gamer tag is "Manok" which means literally translates to **Chicken**, I chose that because it sounded funny

I'm also actively looking for another job, if you wanna know more about my professional experience, here's my portfolio, [manok.dev](https://manok.dev). You can also contact me at [jasper@manok.dev](mailto:jasper@manok.dev).

I use arch and neovim... btw
